                  NISP/SOLIS VSM Data Information
               -------------------------------------


VSM Filename Format:
====================

The VSM data files have the following general filename structures:


 stimp<date>t<time>_<groupid>_<flav>.fts.gz

and

 stimp<date>t<time>_<flav>.fts.gz


The first five characters (stimp) identify the site, obstype, instrument, obsmode, and processing level respectively.

 |------ site ("k" = Kitt Peak)
 ||----- obs type (bias,dark,flat, etc... see below)
 |||---- instrument, always "v" for the VSM
 ||||--- obs mode (6302l, 8542l, 1083i, 6302v ...  see below)
 |||||-- processing level (0,1,2,3 ... see below)
 stimp

    "9"          6302v



VSM Processing Levels:
======================
VSM processing levels indicate the general progressive levels of data processing.  The valid
VSM processing levels are listed below:

Level Char           Description
   "0"               Raw data (spectra)
   "1"               Instrument-corrected data (image)
   "2"               Geometry-corrected data (image)
   "3"               Derived data
   "4"               6302v quick-look level1 data (image)
   "5"               6302v quick-look level2 data (image)
   "6"               6302v quick-look level3 data
   "g"               Level 3 Solis data processed by GONG pipeline
   "s"               Cleaned spectra IV or IQUV (corresponds to level1 images)
   "t"               Mapped cleaned spectra (corresponds to level2 images)



Date and Time:
==============

In general, the date and time will be the UTC start date/time of the observation 
of a given data parameter with the following format:
 
  <date>t<time>
  yymmddthhmmss

  yy = 2-digit year
  mm = month number
  dd = day number
  t  = fixed constant "t"
  hh = UTC hour
  mm = UTC minute
  ss = UTC second 

Synoptic and heliographic maps have the Carrington rotation integrated into the time field and
the seconds are elided from the time field:

  <date>t<time>c<carr>_<deg>

  carr = 4 digit Carrington rotation
  deg = degree offset into Carrington rotation


Flavors:
========
The _<flav> portion of a VSM filename identifies additional information about the file, such
as plot resolution (e.g. "_lr" = low resolution thumbnail) or image plane (e.g. _mag1).  A filename
may contain more than one flavor.

The following table itemizes many of the currently used flavors for VSM data:

  *.reject - product associated with _map-mag product, reporting the number of zero-weight pixels that led to rejection



Mean Field Time Series Parameters:
==================================

Because time series data do not reflect observations taken at a particular time and date, the
<date>t<time> portions of their filenames are fixed at midnight, Jan 1, 1970, or
"700101t000000".  The remaining components of the filenames are as described above.

Navigating NISP Data Archive Directories:
=========================================

When browsing the VSM data manually via ftp://solis.nso.edu/pubkeep or https://solis.nso.edu/pubkeep, the data are stored using the NISP
standard keep structure.  Using the above filename format nomenclature, a file may generically be found at:

/imp/yyyymm/stimpyymmdd/<file>

In this manner, filenames directly specify where the file itself is located in the archive.
For example, the file k4v95121221t185240.fts.gz can be found at:

/v95/201212/k4v95121221/k4v95121221t185240.fts.gz
